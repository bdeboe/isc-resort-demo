    "# Using Foreign Tables\n",
    "### Global Summit 2023 - Demos and Drinks\n",
    "\n",
    "With 2023.1, we're releasing Foreign Tables as an experimental feature of InterSystems IRIS and IRIS for Health. Foreign Tables is a new capability of IRIS SQL that enables users to include data managed elsewhere, in a file or remote database, in regular IRIS SQL queries. Use cases include scenarios in which the ownership, size and rate of change of the remote data make it impractical to load the data into IRIS. Unlike its predecessor Linked Tables that's often used in Interoperability use cases, Foreign Tables have no limitations on how they can be combined with other tables or the syntax that can be used to query them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A Motivating Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're going to reconcile the data architecture for our brand new beachfront resort. Recently, management decided to go with InterSystems IRIS Data Platform for all our data needs -- a very wise decision indeed! Unfortunately, right after acquiring the resort from the previous owner we found out they stored **all** of their data in CSV files. To make matters worse, management originally decided to go with MySQL for the resort's booking system. Most recently, we've used InterSystems IRIS to store all our guest loyalty program data. So we've got a CSV file storing all our room information, a MySQL system storing our reservations, and IRIS storing our loyalty program data -- and it's up to us to bring it all together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, management's decision to go with InterSystems is about to pay off as we can easily unite all this data directly in IRIS with the help of Foreign Tables. All we need to do is create two foreign tables (one to access our MySQL data, one to access our CSV data) and then get to querying just as if we were querying native data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's set up our Python environment to connect to our IRIS instance where we want to create our foreign tables:"
